### Hello World?
This post is more of a test than anything else, but I suppose it is also serves as a functional start to yet another one of my many endeavours. 

Some background:
While I have completed a computer science degree (and am now studying for a PhD), my exposure to *any* form of web development is embarrisingly low... 

As a result, I have taken it upon myself to begin this blog-portfolio-thing to improve both my webdev skills and online presence!


### My webdev strat so far..
There are an overwhelming number of tools and jargon involved in webdev, and there seems to be little-to-no consensus on the 'best' tools to use. 
However, my years of experience with *various other* "techs, stacks and hacks" have provided me with enough confidence to just pick something that just works. 
I'll learn-as-I-go and incrementally improve things as I inevitably get better with practice.

I am using GitHub pages because it's free, and Jekyll because it comes recommened from GitHub pages. 
Using the templates is great as I have been able to get a functional/presentable website running in less than 30 minutes (and I simply do not have the time to implement *everything* from scratch).

I might want to share some code snippets from time to time, which Jekyll seems to handle quite nicely:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

And I'm sure that as I add more to these pages, I will likely begin implementing my own custom 'web stuff' when my priorities allow me to. 
If you are interested in setting up your own personal site, I would highly recommend using [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] and [GitHub pages][gh-pages] - suprisingly pain-free so far!

[jekyll-docs]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
[gh-pages]: https://pages.github.com/


### My content plan
As far as the actual contents of the website, I will aim to write a post every month (perhaps more, perhaps less) that sums up any interesting work I've done recently, problems I've solved and any things I want to discuss. 

Another aim is to just generally try to keep eveything here as up-to-date as possible (we'll see how that goes)...
Because, being able to simply link <this site> to people seems like it will be a useful/easy way to show them what I do.




Cheers,

Ieuan
